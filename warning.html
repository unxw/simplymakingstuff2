      <h1>WARNING</h1>
     <p>If you want to play, here are some things you need to do. First,<strong> if you do not have an "Intel Inside" sticker, that means the game will not run an you are on an "ARM" prosessor.</strong> Now, if you do have an intel inside sticker, that most likely means that you can play. So, what you are going to do now is that you are going to enter the game with the link below, and this part is <strong>very important</strong> you need to use a username that you will not change. This is because if you change it, you will lose all of your progress in your game. Finally, hit multiplayer once you are in, and hit edit on the template server then <h2><strong>write this IP down: wss://mc.primitt.dev/survival</strong></h2> (to actually play in the server you have to type "/register <password here> <confirm password>) HAVE FUN!       <p>
